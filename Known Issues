The Setupx86 project is not currently set up properly. This means that running the resulting setup program does not yeild the expected results. As this affects the x86 setup program, x64 builds should not be affected as long as, when you build the solution, you choose to build TVGuide with Setup, as opposed to Setupx86. Setupx86 is designed to be used with x86 builds of the TVGuide project only.
